# Equal Weight Index Fund Engine

Calculator and engine written in Python 3, making use of pandas, NumPy and the IEX Cloud API to generate recommended trades with equally weighted long positions given a desired total portfolio value and a list of symbols to trade.

**NOTE:** This package uses IEX Cloud's sandbox API (can be changed in config.py) by default and should not be used to trade!
